# Custom-AI-Chatbot
Chatbot implemented in Python, using OpenAI's API, LlamaIndex, Langchain, Gradio and PyPDF2. 

Implemented for Ecolytics, with the purpose of training on custom data about the B-Corp Sustainability Certification to answer client business queries on how best to meet sustainability standards. Data scraped off of B-Lab's publicly available guide.

The code sets up a custom-trained AI chatbot using the GPT-3.5-turbo language model from OpenAI. The code requires several Python packages to be installed using pip. These packages are:

# packages used
openai: for using the OpenAI GPT-3 API.
gpt_index: version 0.4.24, a custom library for creating GPT-based indices.
PyPDF2: for working with PDF files.
PyCryptodome: for cryptographic operations.
gradio: a user-friendly web interface for the chatbot.
llama-index: version 0.5.6, a library for managing language models in the GPT-3 ecosystem.
langchain: version 0.0.118, a library containing chat models.

Once these packages are installed, the code proceeds to define and set up the chatbot. Here's a summary of the code:

# modules and libraries used:

gpt_index: Various modules for working with GPT-3 models and creating an index.
langchain.chat_models: Contains the ChatOpenAI class, which is a GPT-3 chat model.
gradio: For building the web interface of the chatbot.
sys and os: Python standard libraries for system-level operations.
Set the OpenAI API key: The OpenAI API key is set as an environment variable using os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"].



# code explanation

Define a function construct_index(directory_path): This function constructs an index for the chatbot by training on the text data from the specified directory. The function uses a pre-trained GPT-3.5-turbo model (ChatOpenAI) for language modeling. The index is saved to disk as index.json and returned.

Define a function chatbot(input_text): This function takes an input text and uses the pre-constructed index to query for a response from the chatbot. The response is returned.

Create the Gradio interface:The Gradio interface is defined using gr.Interface, which takes the chatbot function as the main function to be called. It has a single input, a textbox where the user can enter text for the chatbot. The output is set to be a simple text display.

Construct the index and launch the Gradio interface: The construct_index function is called to build the chatbot index from the data in the "data" directory. 
The Gradio interface is then launched with the iface.launch(share=True) command.

With this code, users can interact with the custom-trained AI chatbot using the Gradio web interface, providing input text and receiving responses generated by the GPT-3.5-turbo model.
